# Code-for-Velezuela-Hackathon
Winning solution for interactive dashboard for NGOs.

As a part of the challenge my team was creating an interactive dashboard to represent the most urgent needs of hospitals in Velezuela. We were provided with raw data collected from each participating hospital weekly, which needed some cleaning and transformation. Resulting dashboard was built in Tableau.
